**Auto-Generate Invoices From Your Notion Data**

This isn't an invoice template. It's a complete client management system where everything is linked: Clients → Projects → Invoices. Enter hours, get calculated totals, export PDF in 60 seconds.

**Pre-populated with 5 sample clients. Real data. Real workflow. Real time saved.**

---

## The Problem

You're a freelancer. You track clients and projects in Notion. But when it's time to invoice:

1. Open Notion → Find project hours
2. Open Sheets → Calculate totals
3. Open Canva/Google Docs → Design invoice
4. Copy-paste client info
5. Do math in your head
6. Export PDF
7. Send from Gmail
8. **15 minutes wasted**

**Every. Single. Invoice.**

---

## The Solution

**One database. Zero copy-pasting. Auto-calculated totals.**

**The 60-Second Workflow:**

1. **Project done** → Click "Invoices" database
2. **+ New** → Create invoice
3. **Select client** → Auto-links their info
4. **Select project** → Auto-links the work
5. **Enter hours** → **Rate auto-fills**
6. **Subtotal calculates** → Hours × Rate
7. **Tax calculates** → Optional
8. **Total calculates** → Ready
9. **Export → PDF** → Send

**14 minutes saved. Every invoice.**

## Why Notion Can't Do This Natively

**Notion doesn't have:**
- Pre-populated data (you start blank)
- Formula-calculated invoice totals in templates
- Linked client-project-invoice relationships by default

**This template gives you:**
- Pre-built linked databases
- Auto-calculating formulas
- Real-world sample data
- PDF export workflow

**It's the system Notion users build themselves over weeks. We built it for you.**

---

## Pricing

**$19** — One-time purchase

**Value proposition:**
- Saves 2 hours/month
- 12 invoices × 15 min saved = 3 hours
- At $50/hr value = $150/month saved
- **Payback: 12 minutes of use**

---

## The "Not Just a Template" Philosophy

**Free invoice templates:**
- Give you a blank page
- You fill in every field manually
- Zero automation
- No client linking

**Freelancer Command Center:**
- Pre-populated with real examples
- Auto-calculates from linked data
- 60-second invoice workflow
- Complete client management system

**That's the $19 difference.**

---

## Ideal Customer

✅ **You if:**
- Track clients/projects in Notion (or want to)
- Invoice 2–10 times/month
- Bill hourly or flat-rate
- Hate copy-pasting between apps
- Want auto-calculated totals

❌ **Not you if:**
- You use QuickBooks/Xero for accounting
- You have 50+ clients (need real CRM)
- You invoice daily (need specialized tool)
- You want Canva-designed invoices only (we include those too, but Notion is faster)
