## The Problem

As a freelancer, you track clients and projects in Notion. But invoicing is a mess:

1. Find project hours in Notion
2. Calculate totals in Sheets
3. Design invoice in Canva/Docs
4. Copy-paste client info
5. Do math manually
6. Export, send, track
7. **15 minutes wasted per invoice**

**Every. Time.**

---

## The Solution

**One database. Zero copy-pasting. Auto-calculated totals.**

## See → Generate → Send

1. **Project done** → Click Invoices database
2. **+ New** → Create invoice
3. **Select client** → Auto-fills info
4. **Select project** → Links work
5. **Enter hours** → **Rate auto-fills**
6. **Subtotal auto-calculates**
7. **Tax auto-calculates**
8. **Total auto-calculates**
9. **Export PDF** → Send

**60 seconds. From database to sent invoice.**

## ✨ What Makes This Different

### Pre-Populated With Real Data

**Not blank pages** — real examples you can learn from:

| Client | Industry | Rate | Status |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| Sarah Chen | SaaS | $150/hr | Active |
| Marcus Johnson | Coaching | $120/hr | Active |
| GreenLeaf Organics | E-commerce | $100/hr | Active |
| Apex Marketing | Agency | $175/hr | Prospective |
| Elena Ruiz | Non-profit | $80/hr | Paused |

Each client has:
- ✅ Contact info & payment terms
- ✅ Linked projects
- ✅ Invoice history
- ✅ Lifetime value tracking

### Auto-Calculating Everything

| Field | Formula | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Subtotal | `Hours × Rate` | Auto |
| Tax | `Subtotal × Tax Rate` | Auto |
| Total | `Subtotal + Tax` | Auto |

**Enter hours. Get complete invoice totals.**

### Linked Databases

```
Client: Sarah Chen ($150/hr)
  → Projects: Landing Page, Dashboard UX
    → Invoices: INV-001 ($3,750), INV-008 ($4,500)
      → Dashboard: Revenue, Outstanding, Overdue
```

**Everything connected.** Change a rate, future invoices update.

## 📈 Market Validation

**Research findings:**
- Notion has official Invoice Generator (4.9★, 45 reviews)
- Multiple free templates exist
- BUT: No template combines **client management + auto-invoicing** with **pre-populated data**

**Our differentiation:**
- Not just invoices — **the full system**
- Not blank pages — **real examples**
- Not manual math — **auto-calculation**

**The pitch:** *"Stop juggling 5 apps"* vs *"Here's an invoice template"*
